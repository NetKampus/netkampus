# Vision

## Problem

UNAL Bogotá has many valuable activities, but announcements are fragmented (groups, chats, posters) and easy to miss.

## Goal

Provide a single place to discover student groups and events, RSVP, and track what’s happening on campus.

## Target Users

- Students who want to attend events.
- Student groups / organizers who publish events.

## MVP Success Criteria

- A student can sign in with a UNAL email and RSVP to an event.
- An organizer can create a group and publish an event with capacity.

## Non-Goals (for MVP)

- Full social feed (posts/comments)
- Mobile app
- Advanced recommendations / personalization
